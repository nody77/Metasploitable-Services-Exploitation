## Metasploitable 2 - port 23 TELNET - Exploitation

Before exploiting or running a payload on that port we first need to make sure that it is open

```Terminal
nmap -p 23 -sV <metasplitable ip address>
```

Then let's open the msfconsole to search for an telnet login payload

As we are now tring to exploit telnet port we will choose the second option

```Terminal
use 1
```

Then we need to show the options of it 

```Terminal 
show options
```

So as how we exploited the ssh port we need to pass the same things to it again
As we can see we need to pass the rhost by giving it the metasploitable machine ip address 
and pass the user_file and pass_file by giving it a text file like a wordlist to try different user names and passwords to login
>I used the user pass wordlist of metasploitable for the pass_file 
and I opened a new text file by nano and write some common user names for the user_file
And we need to set the stop on success option to true so that when the payload is running it stop when it find the first match

And then exploit the payload 
After some time it will give you the Telnet sessions that the payload could enter through it.
